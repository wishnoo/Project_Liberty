I worked there for a few months after which I joined the Mineral Engineering Department at the University of Mines and Technology, Tarkwa, Ghana as a National Service Person. There I developed software tools for comminution under the supervision of Dr. Richard Amankwah. <br><br>
				In 2009, I joined Missouri University of Science and Technology (Missouri S&T) to pursue my Master of Science degree in Computer Science under the supervision of Dr. Xiaoqing (Frank) Liu. During this time, I worked on security requirements analysis and specification on cloud and cyber-physical systems. After graduation, I worked as an Assistant Lecturer for the Computer Science and Engineering department at the Univesity of Mines and Technology for a year. I returned back to Missouri S&T in 2012 to work on my Ph.D. degree in computer science also under the supervision of Dr. Xiaoqing (Frank) Liu. I am currently an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at University of Massachusetts Boston (UMass Boston). Prior to joining UMass Boston, I worked with Product Innovation and Engineering as a Software Engineer. There I developed part decomposition algorithms for the Siemens' NX software. <br><br> I love to fly fish and play soccer.</div></p>
