            <img src="images/kkfletcher_fly_fishing.jpg" width="434" height="228" class="img2"> After receiving my bachelor of science degree in computer science in 2006, I worked as an intern at <a href="https://www.goldfields.co.za/index.php" target="new">Goldfields Ghana Limited</a>, Tarkwa Mine. I worked there for a few months after which I joined the Mineral Engineering Department at the <a href="https://www.umat.edu.gh/" target="new">University of Mines and Technology</a>, Tarkwa, Ghana as a National Service Person. There I developed software tools for comminution under the supervision of <a href="http://www.umat.edu.gh/staffinfo/staffDetailed.php?contactID=2" target="new">Dr. Richard Amankwah</a>. <br><br>
            In 2009, I joined Missouri University of Science and Technology (Missouri S&T) to pursue my Master of Science degree in Computer Science under the supervision of <a href="http://computer-science-and-computer-engineering.uark.edu/directory/index/uid/frankliu/name/Xiaoqing-Liu/" target="new">Dr. Xiaoqing (Frank) Liu</a>. During this time, I worked on security requirements analysis and specification on cloud and cyber-physical systems. After graduation, I worked as an Assistant Lecturer for the Computer Science and Engineering department at the Univesity of Mines and Technology for a year. I returned back to Missouri S&T in 2012 to work on my Ph.D. degree in computer science also under the supervision of <a href="http://computer-science-and-computer-engineering.uark.edu/directory/index/uid/frankliu/name/Xiaoqing-Liu/" target="new">Dr. Xiaoqing (Frank) Liu</a>. I am currently an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at University of Massachusetts Boston (UMass Boston). Prior to joining UMass Boston, I worked with Product Innovation and Engineering as a Software Engineer. There I developed part decomposition algorithms for the Siemens' NX software. <br><br> I love to fly fish and play soccer.

        The main focus of my research is to develop methods and algorithms that incorporate users’ preferences for service selection and recommendation. Specifically, I am currently focusing on how to include user preferences on non-functional attributes (such as reliability, response time and availability) on machine learning algorithms for services/cloud services selection and recommendation. <br><br>
        I also have interest in additive manufacturing (3D printing) and its applications in the aerospace and automobile industry. I have recently started looking at additive manufacturing application in dentistry.
